- Add a rectangle
- controllable by keyboard
    - input is a type of controller
- create controller dir: one is 'Start game=add player'
- add visible walls
    - single Item, shape is multiple rectangles
- model update methods are actually controllers. Be aware of 'model death
  problem' - controller may reference models that no longer exist.
  Need some mechanism to call each controller every frame
  (e.g. collection of controllers) Improvements include ordering calls to
  controllers, or not calling those that have declared themselves 'asleep'.
- collision detection with walls
- add start game screen
- add score
- add a sound: tank drive
- bitmaps on each rect, all from the same imageatlas
- tank treads, tank turret:
    - model may be 'attached to' another model. view collection stores this
      as a tree, so that matrices can be applied cumulatively. Or maybe each
      item has an 'items' collection, just like the world.
- enemy tanks
- world provides .items('aspect') which returns set of items filtered by
  those that have given attribute. (this instead of filtered by class as
  done in SinisterDucks.)
